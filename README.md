# Mammogram-BIRAD-Classification

The "Mammogram-BIRAD-Classification" repository, created by bwallison, is a project dedicated to the classification of mammogram images based on the BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) system. The repository offers code, data, and resources specifically tailored for this task.

It provides implementations of machine learning algorithms and techniques suitable for mammogram image classification. The goal is to accurately classify mammograms based on the BIRADS system, which provides standardized categories for breast imaging interpretation.
